I have started my web development coding by starting from scratch in the holidays.
It's hard to find the assets(images/videos/required models) than finding the learning contents.
To devleop by basic knowlege about html,css,js clearly,I made the learning and coding them with the help of youtube channels with their assets.
Practising makes a man perfect is obvious,as by learning it by implementing them gives a clear knowledge rather than watching many youtube videos.


Try to type and understand the codes rather than directly copying them coz, typing and analysing the code provides an complete knowledge of the program helps in using them for your upcoming works
